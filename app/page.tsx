            Hate crimes represent a significant challenge to societal harmony,
            often exposing deep-rooted prejudices and systemic inequalities.
            This research examines hate crimes reported in the United States
            from 1991 to 2021, drawing from a comprehensive and reliable dataset
            officially published by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
            The extensive time frame of this study provides an opportunity to
            analyze long-term trends and patterns in hate crime incidents.
            Specifically, the research explores the correlations between
            offenders&apos; and victims&apos; racial identities, the locations
            targeted, and the nature of offenses committed at those locations.
